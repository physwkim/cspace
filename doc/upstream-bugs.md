# Upstream bugs

Upstream is `moveit2` at `e017c91ee12984393a28ba246075c65f69cde3bf`,
checked out at `/home/stevek/work/moveit2` (`PORTING-PLAN.md:3`). Every
`file:line` below is repository-relative to that checkout and was read
there; entry 5 is the exception and says so.

A defect that exists in the C++ MoveIt sources this workspace ports from.
Its entry belongs here, not in a code comment alone, and **the default is
that the port does not reproduce it**.

This inverts the rule the port ran under until now. Several comments in the
tree say some version of *"this looks like an upstream bug, but the brief
for this port is to transcribe the numerics as written, not to fix
behaviour no test here contradicts"* — that brief no longer holds. Those
sites are listed below with their current status so the change is visible
rather than silent.

## What belongs here

An upstream **bug**: behaviour a competent reviewer of the C++ would call
wrong — out-of-bounds indexing, a NaN escaping into a returned value, state
overwritten by two branches that were meant to be exclusive, a guard the
upstream author's own comment doubts.

An upstream **deviation** is a different thing and does not belong here.
Deviations are behaviour this port changes for reasons of language, safety
or API shape, and they are classified `D1`..`D25` in `PORTING-PLAN.md`.
A bug that we decline to reproduce will usually also acquire a deviation
class; record it in both places and cross-reference.

Not a bug: behaviour that merely surprises. `Trajectory::velocity` being a
step function of time reads like an oversight and is entry 4 below, but it
is upstream's actual, oracle-confirmed behaviour — the question of whether
to keep it is a *parity* decision, not a defect report.

## Entry format

Append entries; do not renumber existing ones.

```
### N. <one-line symptom> — <status>

**Upstream:** <file:line in the C++ source, with the version or path root>
**Port:**     <file:line in this workspace>
**Symptom:**  what the C++ does that is wrong, concretely.
**Evidence:** how we know — oracle run, upstream's own TODO, a read of the
              control flow. Say which; a read is the weakest.
**Status:**   `not-reproduced` | `reproduced-deliberately` | `reproduced-grandfathered`
**Cost of not reproducing:** which parity tests or oracle comparisons move
              if we deviate. If none, say none.
```

`reproduced-deliberately` needs a stated reason and a signature — it is the
exception now, not the default.

`reproduced-grandfathered` is closed to new entries. It marks the bugs
already in the tree when the policy inverted, which the user decided on
2026-08-05 to leave in place; see "Decision on the pre-policy entries"
below. A bug found from now on is `not-reproduced` unless someone argues
`reproduced-deliberately` for it.

### 1. Two non-exclusive `if` blocks double-increment `iteration_` — reproduced-grandfathered

**Upstream:** `moveit_planners/chomp/chomp_motion_planner/src/chomp_optimizer.cpp:368-410`
(verified at the pinned `e017c91e`: `if (iteration_ % 10 == 0)` sets
`num_collision_free_iterations_ = 0` and `iteration_++`; the separate
`if (!parameters_->filter_mode_)` at `:406` sets it to
`max_iterations_after_collision_free_` and increments `iteration_` again)
**Port:** `crates/moveit-planners-chomp/src/optimizer.rs:909`
**Symptom:** the `iteration_ % 10 == 0` mesh-to-mesh check and the
`!filter_mode_` collision-threshold check are two separate,
unconditionally-evaluated `if` blocks rather than `if`/`else if`. Both can
fire in one pass: the first increments `iteration_` and zeroes
`num_collision_free_iterations_`, then the second increments `iteration_`
a *second* time in the same loop pass and overwrites
`num_collision_free_iterations_` with `max_iterations_after_collision_free_`.
**Evidence:** read of upstream control flow. Not oracle-confirmed.
**Cost of not reproducing:** unmeasured — CHOMP iteration counts would
change, so any test pinning an iteration count or a converged trajectory
is at risk.

### 2. Contact-reporting branch indexes `link_body_decompositions_` out of bounds — not-reproduced

**Upstream:** `moveit_core/collision_distance_field/src/collision_env_distance_field.cpp:601`
(verified: `con.pos = gsr->link_body_decompositions_[i]->getSphereCenters()[k];`
unconditional, with `if (i_is_link)` first appearing at `:604` for `body_type_1`)
**Port:** `crates/moveit-distance-field/src/collision_env_distance_field.rs:1871`
**Symptom:** the branch unconditionally reads
`con.pos = gsr->link_body_decompositions_[i]->getSphereCenters()[k]`
without branching on `i_is_link`, unlike `body_type_1` immediately below
(`:604-611`). When `i` is an attached-body index this reads past the end of
a vector sized `num_links` — undefined behaviour.
**Evidence:** read of upstream control flow, cross-checked in round 26
(an earlier citation of `:534`/`:537-544` was wrong; the bug claim was not).
**Status:** already not reproduced — safe Rust cannot express it.
**Cost of not reproducing:** none. Already the shipped behaviour.

### 3. Attached-body count check upstream's own comment doubts — reproduced-grandfathered

**Upstream:** `moveit_core/collision_distance_field/src/collision_env_distance_field.cpp:1132`
(verified verbatim: `// TODO: This logic for checking attached body count might
be incorrect`, guarding
`gsr->attached_body_decompositions_.size() != att->getShapes().size()`)
**Port:** `crates/moveit-distance-field/src/collision_env_distance_field.rs:1055`
**Symptom:** upstream's own author flagged the comparison as possibly
wrong and it was shipped unchanged.
**Evidence:** upstream's own TODO. What the check *should* compare has not
been established here.
**Cost of not reproducing:** unknown until the correct comparison is
established. Do not deviate before that.

### 4. `getVelocity` never re-derives its time step against the query time — reproduced-deliberately

**Upstream:** `moveit_core/trajectory_processing/src/time_optimal_trajectory_generation.cpp:881-895`
(verified: `getPosition` re-assigns `time_step = time - previous->time_` at
`:874` before computing `path_pos`; `getVelocity` never does, computing
`path_pos` and `path_vel` at `:891-893` from the `:887` full-segment step)
**Port:** `crates/moveit-trajectory/src/trajectory.rs:217`
**Symptom:** it computes `path_pos`/`path_vel` from the *full* enclosing
segment's step (`it->time_ - previous->time_`) rather than against the
query time the way `getPosition` does (`time - previous->time_`). For any
`time` inside a segment it returns the value at `current.time_` — a step
function of `time`, constant within each segment. `acceleration` shares the
property via `segment_endpoint_state`.
**Evidence:** oracle. An earlier, "fixed" version of this port disagreed
with the `totg` oracle op; see `tests/totg_parity.rs`.
**Status:** reproduced deliberately. This is the one entry where reproducing
is clearly right — it is upstream's observable behaviour, confirmed against
a running oracle, and the port's parity claim is built on it.
**Cost of not reproducing:** `tests/totg_parity.rs` fails. Deviating here
means abandoning totg parity, which is a much larger decision than a bug fix.

### 5. `Path_Circle` has no both-zero guard, so `scale_rot` can be NaN — reproduced-grandfathered

**Upstream:** `orocos_kdl/src/path_circle.cpp:91-96` in
`orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics`, checked out at
`/home/stevek/work/orocos_kinematics_dynamics` (master `c73370f0`). This is
not the pinned reference `moveit2` builds against — KDL is a system
dependency there — but `git log -L` dates the `Path_Circle` `else` arm to
`d545368` (2020) and the `Path_Line` guard to at least `c6f0842` (2008), so
both sides of the asymmetry predate any version this port could target.
`moveit2`'s `pilz_industrial_motion_planner/src/path_circle_generator.cpp`
is the *caller*; the missing guard is in KDL itself.
**Port:** `crates/moveit-planners-pilz/src/path_circle.rs:312`
**Symptom:** `Path_Circle`'s `else` arm runs whenever
`oalpha*eqradius > dist` is false, including when both are zero, and
computes `scalerot = oalpha/pathlength` with `pathlength = dist = 0`. That
is `0.0/0.0` = NaN escaping into the constructed path. `radius` is guarded
`>= epsilon` at `:66`, so reaching it needs `alpha == 0` (zero-sweep
circle) together with an identity start/end rotation, which makes
`oalpha == 0`.
**Evidence:** verified verbatim in the checkout above, and the asymmetry is
upstream's own: `orocos_kdl/src/path_line.cpp:67-83` carries the comment
`// Only modify if non zero (prevent division by zero)` above a three-way
guard whose third arm is commented `// both were zero`. KDL recognised this
division and fixed it in `Path_Line`; `Path_Circle` never got the same
treatment. That makes it an unfixed instance of a known bug rather than a
deliberate choice.
**Cost of not reproducing:** unmeasured. A `Path_Line`-shaped guard
returning an error is the obvious candidate, and no pilz parity test is
known to depend on the NaN — that needs checking, not assuming.

### 6. `inv_twice_resolution_` mistyped as `int`, silently truncating — reproduced-deliberately

**Upstream:** `moveit_core/distance_field/include/moveit/distance_field/distance_field.hpp:614`
(`int inv_twice_resolution_;` among otherwise-`double` fields) and
`moveit_core/distance_field/src/distance_field.cpp:67`
(`inv_twice_resolution_(1.0 / (2.0 * resolution_))`, a `double` expression
narrowed into that `int` field at construction), used unconditionally at
`:91-93` (`gradient_x/y/z = (...) * inv_twice_resolution_`) — verified at
the pinned `e017c91e`.
**Port:** `crates/moveit-distance-field/src/distance_field.rs:427`
(`let inv_twice_resolution = (1.0 / (2.0 * self.resolution())) as i32 as
f64;`), documented in-line at `:368-426` and again in
`crates/moveit-distance-field/src/lib.rs:991-998`.
**Symptom:** `1.0 / (2.0 * resolution)` is truncated toward zero into an
`int` on every construction. For most resolutions this changes the
gradient multiplier from the mathematically exact value to upstream's
truncated one — e.g. `resolution = 0.03` gives `16.666...` untruncated
but upstream's stored multiplier is `16`. Past `resolution >= 0.51` the
truncated multiplier is `0`, so every returned gradient is identically
zero on both sides of the port.
**Evidence:** oracle, boundary-pinned. Round 26 found the two originally-
ported upstream tests both happen to use resolutions (`0.1`, `0.02`)
where the ratio is already an exact integer, so the truncation was a
no-op there and the divergence went unmeasured until then; the port now
casts through `i32` to reproduce the truncation bit-for-bit rather than
matching it by coincidence, and
`distance_gradient_truncates_inv_twice_resolution_like_upstreams_int_
field`/`distance_gradient_multiplier_is_one_at_the_zero_boundary`/
`distance_gradient_multiplier_is_zero_just_past_the_boundary`
(`distance_field.rs:1190-1260`) pin it, including the `0.5`/`0.51` zero
boundary. Cross-referenced in `PORTING-PLAN.md` §172.1 case 1.
**Status:** reproduced deliberately — this is genuine parity (upstream's
own gradient is equally truncated), not a residual bug, and this crate's
mandate is matching upstream's actual behaviour rather than its intent
(see `crate::get_body_decomposition_cache_entry`'s doc for the same
principle applied elsewhere in this crate).
**Cost of not reproducing:** the three tests named above fail; any
resolution not equal to an exact-integer-ratio value would silently
diverge from upstream by a measurable, non-error gradient-magnitude
difference.

One further boundary inside the same guard does **not** match upstream
and is left that way deliberately (`PORTING-PLAN.md` §153.1 — expires if
upstream ever changes `inv_twice_resolution_`'s declared type away from
`int`): below `resolution ≈ 2.328e-10`, `1.0/(2.0*resolution)` exceeds
`i32::MAX`, where Rust's `as i32` saturates (well-defined since Rust
1.45) but C++'s narrowing conversion of an out-of-range `double` is UB —
there is no upstream value to match even in principle. This sub-case is
undocumented-and-unreachable in this crate's current tests/oracle
fixtures (the smallest resolution used anywhere is two orders of
magnitude larger), not silently wrong in a reachable case today, but is
recorded here per `distance_field.rs:404-426` rather than left for the
next audit to rediscover.

### 7. `max_distance_sq_`'s narrowing would OOM if unguarded — not-reproduced

**Upstream:** `moveit_core/distance_field/src/propagation_distance_field.cpp:88`
(`max_distance_sq_ = ceil(max_distance_ / resolution_) *
ceil(max_distance_ / resolution_);`, a `double` product narrowed into an
`int` field with no range check before it) used at `:95-96,99-100` to
size `bucket_queue_`/`negative_bucket_queue_`/`sqrt_table_` — verified at
the pinned `e017c91e`.
**Port:** `crates/moveit-distance-field/src/propagation.rs:218`
(`checked_max_distance_sq`), documented in-line at `:199-217`.
**Symptom:** past `n > 46340` (`n*n > i32::MAX`, where `n =
ceil(max_distance/resolution)`), C++'s narrowing is UB with no upstream
value to match; an unguarded Rust `as i32` would instead saturate to
`i32::MAX`, and `PropagationDistanceField::new` sizes three collections
from that value — an attempted allocation of three `2^31`-length
collections (OOM), not merely a wrong number.
**Evidence:** read of upstream control flow, cross-referenced in
`PORTING-PLAN.md` §172.1 case 2.
**Status:** already not reproduced — `checked_max_distance_sq` rejects
`max_distance_sq_f > f64::from(i32::MAX)` before ever casting, returning
`Error::Construct` instead of saturating into the allocation.
**Cost of not reproducing:** none. Already the shipped behaviour; a
valid-per-this-guard value like `46340 * 46340` (~2.1 billion) is itself
far too large to build a field around, so the boundary is tested via the
standalone `checked_max_distance_sq` helper rather than by actually
constructing a field at that size.

### 8. `getShortestSolution` dereferences `min_element` on a possibly-empty vector — not-reproduced

**Upstream:** `moveit_ros/planning/planning_pipeline_interfaces/src/
solution_selection_functions.cpp:47-64` (`getShortestSolution`: `const
auto shortest_trajectory = std::min_element(solutions.begin(),
solutions.end(), ...); ... return *shortest_trajectory;` at `:64`,
unconditional, with no check that `solutions` is non-empty) — verified at
the pinned `e017c91e`.
**Port:** `crates/moveit-planning/src/plan_responses.rs:111`
(`shortest_solution`), documented in-line at `:42-49`.
**Symptom:** on an empty `solutions` vector, `std::min_element` returns
`solutions.end()`, and dereferencing that iterator is undefined
behaviour.
**Evidence:** read of upstream control flow. `min_element`'s empty-input
return contract (`first` when `[first,last)` is empty, i.e. `end()`
in this call) is documented cppreference behaviour, not something that
needs a runtime probe.
**Status:** already not reproduced — the port's `shortest_solution`
returns `Option<&PlanOutcome<'_>>`, `None` for the empty case, a typed
empty case rather than a panic or a fabricated element. For non-empty
input the tie-break matches upstream's comparator exactly (see the
function's own doc for the strict-improvement-fold reasoning against
`Iterator::min_by`'s different tie-break contract).
**Cost of not reproducing:** none. Already the shipped behaviour, and
"reproducing" this one is not meaningfully possible in safe Rust without
introducing a panic where upstream has UB — not a like-for-like trade.

## Decision on the pre-policy entries

Asked on 2026-08-05 whether to measure-then-deviate, deviate immediately,
or document only: **document only, code unchanged.** Entries 1, 3 and 5 are
`reproduced-grandfathered` and stay as they are. Their
cost-of-not-reproducing lines keep the "unmeasured"/"unknown" placeholders,
which is now accurate rather than an outstanding task — no measurement is
owed, because nothing is being changed.

The inverted policy is **forward-looking**. It binds bugs found from here
on; it does not reopen behaviour already ported and gated. Anyone who wants
to move an entry off `reproduced-grandfathered` needs a fresh decision, not
this document.

Entry 4 is separately `reproduced-deliberately` — it is the one entry with
a positive argument for reproducing (the totg oracle), so it does not
depend on the grandfathering above.

The reason for grandfathering rather than fixing is that all three are
behaviour changes against a port whose parity is oracle-verified, and none
of the three has a demonstrated failure in this workspace: entry 1 is a
read of upstream control flow with no oracle run behind it, entry 3 has no
established correct comparison to change *to*, and entry 5's NaN has no
known reaching caller in the pilz tests. Deviating on any of them would
trade a verified behaviour for an unverified one.
