# Shared guard for the gate scripts in this directory. Source it:
#
#   . "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/gate-lib.sh"
#
# Deliberately named neither `check-*` nor `verify-*`: it is a library, and
# both of those names are globs that run every match as a gate.

# Fails the calling gate when the set it was about to examine is empty.
#
# Every gate here ends with an unconditional `echo OK`, so a loop that runs
# zero times prints the same line as a loop that checked every file --
# "green" then means "nothing was examined", which is the one outcome a gate
# must never spell the same way as success. `verify-vendored-fixture-tests.sh`
# and `verify-all.sh` each grew this guard for their own list after the fact;
# this is that rule in one place, so a new gate gets it by calling one
# function rather than by its author remembering the failure mode.
#
# The current sets are all non-empty (the workspace has crates, the fixture
# directories have fixtures), so no call site below fires today. That is the
# point: the loops are driven off the filesystem precisely so they pick up new
# files without anyone updating a list, and the same property makes them go
# quietly empty if a path convention changes. The guard is what turns that
# into a failure instead of a pass.
